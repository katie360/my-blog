# Understanding Capital Markets - A Focus on Options
## What Are Capital Markets?
Capital markets are financial markets where individuals and institutions buy and sell financial securities such as stocks, bonds and derivatives. They play a crucial role in the global economy by providing a way for businesses to raise capital and for investors to make returns. 

## Types of Capital Markets
1. **Equity Markets**: Where stocks/shares are bought and sold. For instance, the NSE provides a platform for investors to buy and sell shares of listed companies.
2. **Debt Markets**: Where fixed income instruments such as corporate and treasury bonds are traded. In these markets, companies or governments issue debt to raise funds.
3. **Derivatives Markets**: Where financial contracts like options, futures and swaps are traded. These contracts derive their value from an underlying asset.
4. **Foreign Exchange Markets**: Where currencies are traded. For example, the Kenyan Shilling (KES) is traded in the forex markets against other currencies like the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR).
Capital Markets may also be classified as  Primary (where new securities are issued (e.g., an IPO, Government Security) or Secondary Market where existing securities are traded among investors (e.g., stock exchanges like the **Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)).

## What Are Derivatives?
A "derivative" is a financial contract whose value is derived from the price of an underlying asset or a group of assets. These assets can range from stocks and bonds to commodities, currencies and more. Derivatives can serve two primary purposes: to manage risk (hedging) or to take on risk with the hope of earning a corresponding reward (speculation).
The most common types of derivatives are options, futures, forwards, and swaps.

## Introduction to Options
Options are a type of derivative that give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price (strike price) before a specified expiration date. In exchange for this right, the buyer pays a premium (price). Options trading can be used for both hedging and speculation, with strategies ranging from simple to complex.
For example, if you believe the price of Safaricom shares (listed on the **Nairobi Securities Exchange**) will increase, you could buy a **call option**, which gives you the right but not the obligation to buy shares at a specific price in the future, allowing you to profit if the share price goes up. Conversely, if you expect the price of a stock to fall, you might buy a **put option**, which gives you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at a specific price in the future, allowing you to profit if the stock price declines.

### Casing Example:
Let's say you buy a call option for **Safaricom Ltd.** at a strike price of KES 120 with an expiration date in 3 months. If Safaricom’s stock price rises to KES 150 on the expiration date, you can buy it at the lower strike price of KES 120 and make a profit of KES 30 per share. Conversely, if the price falls below KES 120 on the expiration date, you would not exercise the option. Rather, you would only lose the premium you paid for the option.

## American vs. European Options
- **American options** can be exercised at any time between the date of purchase and the expiration date, offering greater flexibility. In contrast,
- **European options** can only be exercised at the end of their life, on the expiration date even if the stock price increases significantly before that date.

## Key Terms in Options Trading
- **Strike Price**: The price at which the holder of the option can buy (for call options) or sell (for put options) the underlying asset.
- **Expiration Date**: The date at which the option expires, and the right to buy or sell the underlying asset no longer exists.
- **Premium**: The price paid by the buyer to purchase the option.
- **In-the-Money (ITM)**: When exercising the option results in a profit.
- **At-the-Money (ATM)**: When exercising the option results in no gain or loss
- **Out--the-Money (OTM)**: When exercising the option results in a loss.

## How Are Options Priced?
Options pricing involves calculating the fair value of an option using different models:
1. Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Model
The BSM model is used for European options. It considers the current price of the asset, the strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate to calculate the option’s fair price.
2. Binomial Options Pricing Model
The binomial model is useful for American options. It builds a "tree" of possible future prices, showing how the asset price could move up or down over time. This model works backward to find the option's current value.
This method uses random simulations to predict how the price of the underlying asset might change. It calculates the average value of the option over thousands of scenarios to estimate its price.
3. Put-Call Parity
Put-call parity explains the relationship between the prices of put and call options with the same strike price and expiration. It keeps prices balanced to avoid risk-free profit opportunities (arbitrage).

## Practical Applications of Options
Options can be used in various strategies, such as:
- **Hedging**: Investors particularly use put options to protect against potential losses in their portfolios. For example, a trader might use a put option on **Kenya Power** stock to limit losses if their expectation is that the stock price will tank by the expiration date.
- **Income Generation**: Investors can sell call options against their stock holdings (known as a covered call strategy). This generates income from the premiums received. For instance, if you own shares in **East African Breweries**, you might sell a call option against those shares to earn extra income.
- **Speculation**: Traders can use options to speculate on price movements. For instance, if you believe the price of **Kenya Airways** stock will rise by the expiration date or strike date, you may want to buy a call option to profit from the potential rise in the underlying stock price.
- **Leveraged Positions**: Options allow traders to take large positions with a smaller upfront investment compared to directly buying the stock.

## Risks of Options Trading
While options can provide substantial rewards, they also carry potential risks. Some of the key risks include:
- **Leverage Risk**: Because options allow you to control a large amount of stock with a smaller investment, you can face significant losses if the market moves against your position.
- **Time Decay**: Options lose value as they approach their expiration date, a phenomenon known as "time decay." This means that if the price of the underlying asset doesn't move as expected, the value of your option may decrease as the expiration date draws near.
- **Market Risk**: The price of the underlying asset may not move in the direction you anticipate, leading to potential losses.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Some options may not have enough buyers or sellers, making it difficult to enter or exit positions at the desired price.
It is essential to fully understand these risks and consider your risk tolerance before trading options.

## Conclusion
Options are valuable tools for managing risk, speculating on price movements, and enhancing portfolio returns. Understanding how they work and how they can be used in different strategies is key to making informed decisions in the capital markets.
While options offer significant potential, it’s important to approach them with caution, as they come with inherent risks. Ongoing learning and practice are essential for anyone looking to incorporate options into their investment strategy.
By grasping the basics of options, you can broaden your understanding of financial markets and improve your ability to navigate them.
